In ur Linux basics, we already discussed that linux doesnot have extentions to the files.
It considers extention as filename itself, However we want to know what type of file it is, so that is the reason we 
always tries to make extentions to the files that we create.

In shell we are creating scripts and those we are going to give extentions to understabd that as a shel script.

We learn bash shell here.
So the file name either .bash or .sh

We can execute the script as `bash script.sh`
